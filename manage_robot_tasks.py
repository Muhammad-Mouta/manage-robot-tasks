    """In a futuristic factory, a team of robots is responsible for various tasks,
       but each robot has specific limitations based on its previous assignments.
       This function manages these limitations while considering that tasks can arrive dynamically.

    Args:
        assignments (list[int]): A dynamic list of robot IDs representing tasks assigned over time.
        max_assignments (dict[int, int]):
            A dictionary defining maximum allowable assignments per robot.
        cooldown (int, optional):
            An integer representing the number of subsequent tasks a robot cannot be assigned
            after taking on a new task. Defaults to 3.

    Returns:
        list[int]:
            A filtered list of robots that still can take on tasks,
            maintaining the order of their original assignments.
